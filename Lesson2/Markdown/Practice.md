### Challenges
1. Get user input with the user's name and print out "Hello [Name]". For example if the user's name is Bob then the output should be "Hello Bob".

2. Get a length from the user and print out the area and perimeter of a square with the length given.

3. Get a radius from the user and print out the area and circumference of a circle with the radius given.

4. Get a length from the user and print out the area and perimeter of the square but print out an error message if the length is less than 0 because a square cannot have a negative length.
   
5. Get a boolean from the user and print out the opposite of the boolean. For example if the user enters `true` then the output should be `false`.

6. Get a number from a user and print out if the number is even or odd. For example if the user enters `5` then the output should be `5 is odd`.

7. Get a number from the user and print out the factorial of the number. Lets say the user enters `5` then print the value of 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. If the user enters `7` then print the value of 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. If the user enters `2` then print the value of 2 * 1. If the user enters `0` then print the value of 1.

8. Keep asking the user for numbers until they enter a negative number. Add up all the numbers the user enters and print out the sum.

### Extra Challenges
9. Get an integer from the user and give the value of 21 minus the number. If the number is greater than 21 then print out double the number. If you input `19` then the output should be `2`. If you input `22` then the output should be `44`. If you input `21` then the output should be `0`.

10. Get a number from the user and print out if the number is a multiple of 3 or 5. For example if the user enters `15` then the output should be `15 is a multiple of 3 and 5`. If the user enters `9` then the output should be `9 is a multiple of 3`. If the user enters `10` then the output should be `10 is a multiple of 5`. If the user enters `7` then the output should be `7 is not a multiple of 3 or 5`.

11. Ask for a number from the user for the base and a number for the exponent. Print out the value of the base to the power of the exponent. For example if the user enters `2` for the base and `3` for the exponent then the output should be `8`. If the user enters `3` for the base and `2` for the exponent then the output should be `9`.

12. Get as many numbers from the user until the user types a 0. Add the absolute value of all the numbers and print out the sum. For example if the user enters `1`, `-2`, `3`, `-4`, `0` then the output should be `10`.
